Glassdoor Salaries Web Scrapping & Data Analysis
---
---

Using Selenium & ChromeDriver, this repository allows to scrape
all salaries data from Glassdoor for any job title and city, 
cleaned and organized in a single Excel file. 
The class allows to get split data for: junior/senior positions
full time/intern/consultant parameters, rated/unrated companies.

As an example, I run the code for a junior Data Scientist position
for rated companies in Paris, France (Excel file found in the
respiratory)
